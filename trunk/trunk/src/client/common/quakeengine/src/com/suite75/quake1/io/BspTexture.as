	 * class BspTexture.
	 * 
	 * <p>The Mip texture header is generally followed by (width * height) * (85 / 64) bytes, 
	 * that represent the color indexes of the textures pixels, at different scales. Do not rely on that size however, 
	 * rather consider the offsets described below.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>The pixels are accessed by offsets, with offset1 (resp. 2, 3, 4) pointing to the beginning of the 
	 * color indexes of the picture scaled by 1 (resp. 1/2, 1/4, 1/8). These offsets are relative to the 
	 * beginning of miptex_t.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>The name of the texture is rather irrelevant, except that:</p>
	 * <ul><li>if it begins by * it will be animated like lava or water.</li>
	 * <li>if it begins by + then it will be animated with frames, and the second letter of the name will be the frame number. Those numbers begin at 0, and go up to 9 at the maximum.</li>
     * <li>if if begins with sky if will double scroll like a sky.</li>
     * <li>Beware that sky textures are made of two distinct parts.</li></ul>
