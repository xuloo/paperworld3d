# Roadmap for development of the engine.

= Version 0.2 =

  * Refactor front-end to use Prana framework for injecting dependancies.

  * Refactor server build to run as an application layer on top of jedai.

== Unversioned Features ==

  * Implement Heirachical Grids for collision culling.
  * Collision response system.
  * Add database support (Hibernate).

  * AI Steering behaviours and steering pipeline implementation
  * Server-side AI library - State Machine, Scripting etc.
